    brief: `Hi, I'm Andy! Thanks for stopping by my portfolio page! A bit about me: I've been working in I.T. for over
    8 years. I was previously a Database Analyst and decided that it was time to pursue my dream of becoming
    a software developer. To gain the knowledge I needed to fulfill this dream, I recently graduated from Thinkful,
    an online coding boot camp where I spent about 6 months sharpening my JavaScript and web development skills.
    Software and technology are what I do as a professional; personally, you will likely find me at home playing
    my Nintendo Switch or just hanging out on the couch with my two dogs and my wife. I also enjoy traveling and
    occasionally playing my trumpet (I'm what they call a natural; I'll prove it!). Anyhow, I hope you're enjoying
    my portfolio; it's a bit more creative than my other work.`
