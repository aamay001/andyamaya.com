# JavaScript Themed Portfolio

This is the repo for my project portfolio. [https://andyamaya.com](https://andyamaya.com) 

This portfolio is written in JavaScript and uses React and Redux. It is bootstrapped with create-react-app and only uses a handful of packages.

Clone the repo and edit the file in ```/src/config/``` named ```profile.js``` to make it your own!

Enjoy!
